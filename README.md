Overview Flow Cytometry
- cell type and cell count discovery; enables cell sorting
- cells labeled with fluorescent antibodies are brought into a single cell suspension, which is illuminated with a laser light beam: cellular features produce light scatter (forward angle scatter and side angle scatter)
- different cell types produce forward scatter and side scatter to a different extent
- output: two-parameter plots and single-parameter histograms
